This project lies at the intersection of sports analytics, socio-economic development, and public policy evaluation. Our goal is to investigate how key socio-economic factors (GDP, literacy, health expenditure, education, demographic indicators, and social well-being) over each 4-year Olympic cycle influence a countryâ€™s performance in the subsequent Olympic Games. We will cover the consecutive Olympic cycles (2000 to 2024) to capture trends and assess the impact of sustained investments on Olympic success.
